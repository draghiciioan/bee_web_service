# BeeConect Web Service Fix

## Issue Fixed

The web-service component was failing to build with the following TypeScript errors:

```
src/api.ts(1,19): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'axios' or its corresponding type declarations.
src/context/AuthContext.tsx(1,8): error TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read.
src/context/AuthContext.tsx(1,65): error TS1484: 'ReactNode' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled.
src/pages/CustomerDetailsPage.tsx(2,27): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'react-router-dom' or its corresponding type declarations.
src/routes/index.tsx(2,56): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'react-router-dom' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

## Changes Made

1. Added missing dependencies to `package.json`:
   ```
   axios: ^1.6.7
   react-router-dom: ^6.22.3
   ```

2. Fixed the import syntax in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect, ReactNode } from 'react';
   
   // After
   import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import type { ReactNode } from 'react';
   ```

## Root Cause

1. The project was missing required dependencies:
   - `axios` - Used for API requests in `src/api.ts`
   - `react-router-dom` - Used for routing in multiple files

2. TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.app.json` has `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`, which requires types to be imported using the `import type` syntax.

## How to Test

1. Rebuild the web-service container:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\jhony\Desktop\BeeConect\beeconect-dev
   make web-service
   ```

2. Check that the build completes successfully without TypeScript errors.

3. Access the web service at http://localhost:3001 to verify it's working correctly.

## Additional Notes

The ESLint warning about `react-refresh/only-export-components` in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` is not related to the build errors and won't prevent the application from building or running. It's a linting rule suggesting that files with React's Fast Refresh should only export components, not functions like `useAuth`.
